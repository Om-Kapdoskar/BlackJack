A Simple Card Game : BlackJack Made in C++ 
Blackjack is a popular card game typically played at casinos. The objective of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by having a hand value of 21 or closest to 21 without going over. The game is played with one or more decks of standard playing cards, and each card is assigned a point value. The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards, with the player able to see one of the dealer's cards (the "upcard"). The player can then choose to "hit" and take additional cards, one at a time, or "stand" and keep their current hand. If the player's hand exceeds 21, they lose automatically. The dealer must follow a set of rules for taking additional cards (hit or stand), depending on the casino's rules. The game is also known as 21.
